# MicroViewMonitor
This is a small project to monitor a PCs temp/stats using the microview arduino module. There is an AHCI based project as well as one using windows low level system stats. Was built using the openhardwaremonitor project as a reference for non-AHCI version, then extended for the AHCI version using MS documentation.
Both require either the microview arduino, or a compatible arduino with a display module.
